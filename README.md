# `smolram`

This is a fork from coq-tinyram which implements a fully formalized virtual machine for the (Harvard) TinyRam architecture. The Future plan of TinyRam is to extend it with an assembler and compiler from some more abstract imperative language, and C, eventually.

## Build and launch emacs or vscodium with coq available, for an interactive session

1. [Install `nix`](https://nixos.org/download.html)
2. `nix develop .#emacs` or `nix develop .#vscodium`
3. Run `emacs` or `codium` from your terminal, either will now be available in
   your environment, for the duration of the shell.

## Get a development environment in a shell, without using emacs or vscodium


1. `nix develop`

## Compile `.v` files

```sh
dune build
```

Note that this can take in excess of 30 minutes, depending on your system. This will also create a new copy of `Tinyram_VM.hs`, extracted from the Coq files, within the `_build` directory, a copy of which can be found in the `src` folder.

## Compile `.hs` files

```sh
cabal new-build
```

and they can be run with

```sh
cabal new-run
```

## Mess around

Open up one of `theories/*.v` and type `C-c C-ENTER` to start the interactive session. Recall that `C-` is emacs-speak for holding the `CTRL` key.

## Customize

Explore `nix/doom.d/*` to get a feel for what tools you've been given and things you might want to change, disable, or add.
